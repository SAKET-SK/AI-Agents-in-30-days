He was dressed in a sequined tutu and sunglasses, ready to perform his famous “Llama Shuffle.” Crowds gathered, phones were out, and everyone was ready to record the most ridiculous viral moment of the day. But just as he started to shimmy, a seagull named Sir Caw-a-lot swooped down, mistaking Larry for a giant piñata.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a brief tussle, Larry regained his composure and continued to dance, but Sir Caw-a-lot had other plans. With a flurry of feathers and a flappy frenzy, he accidentally knocked over a giant inflatable banana that was part of the park's decorations. The banana rolled down the hill, picking up speed and gathering a following of confused joggers and startled squirrels.\n",

       "Before anyone could say “Who slipped on a peel?” the giant banana crashed into a hot dog stand, sending sausages flying like confetti. People ran in every direction, squealing with laughter while dodging flying wieners. A nearby mime, trying to make sense of it all, ended up trapped in an invisible box of hot dogs.\n",

       "In the end, Wackytown learned a valuable lesson: Always be careful when dancing with llamas… and maybe avoid giant inflatable fruit. As the sun set, laughter filled the air, and the townsfolk agreed that disasters were just funny stories waiting to happen."

    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different Prompts = Different Outputs**\n",
    "   - The same story idea created 3 totally different stories\n",
    "   - The prompt/instructions control the style and tone\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AI as a Judge**\n",
    "   - We used AI to evaluate AI-generated content\n",
    "   - This is called an \"evaluator pattern\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Pattern**\n",
    "   - We had multiple \"agents\" (the 3 story writers) work on the same task\n",
    "   - Then one \"judge agent\" evaluated them all\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structured Output (JSON)**\n",
    "   - We asked for JSON so we could easily use the results in code\n",
    "   - This makes the AI's output more useful for programs\n",
    "\n",
    "**This pattern is used in real applications for:**\n",
    "- Generating multiple options and picking the best\n",
    "- A/B testing different approaches\n",
    "- Quality control and evaluation\n",
    "- Creative brainstorming"
