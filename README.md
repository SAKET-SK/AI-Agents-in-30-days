# AI-Agents-in-30-days
This is an intensive 6-week program to master Agentic AI. We start by building foundational expertise, connecting LLMs using proven design patterns. Then, each week, we upskill with new frameworks: OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph and Autogen. The course culminates with a full week on the remarkable opportunities opened up by MCP.
